Shawn Lorenzen: Left-handed Author, writer, speaker, teacher, professor, husband of one, father of three, student of rabbi Yeshua (king of the universe and savior of all mankind). 

For those of you who know me, you probably didn't know these 11: ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bdec7a8c-4b3c-4035-8440-c11575fda4e6.jpg)

1\. I'm a lumber jack (of sorts). I fell, cut and quarter between 8-10 trees a year to heat my house (I do all of this by myself, and it can be exhausting). 

2\. I sharpen my own chain for my chainsaw.

3\. I can run an 110 HP tractor with almost any attachment on the PTO - my favorite is the rototiller. 

4\. I have a green thumb, and grow nursery trees/stock for fun. 

5\. I enjoy carpentry and woodworking (my most recent project was building a Poustinia in my back yard). 

6\. These days, I probably write more than I read. 

7\. After ten years of working to enjoy coffee, I am finally having mild forms of success. 

8\. My afternoons are usually spent playing baseball with my son. 

9\. I prefer black tea, enjoy most herbal teas, and dislike most "hot" green tea. 

10\. Throughout my day, I often think fondly of the good people (friends and family) who have been a significant influence within my life - none of them are "famous" and none of them hold or lord positions of power over others - I thank God for that and for them. 

11\. I have a love/hate relationship with my beard - I keep it because of that relationship.
